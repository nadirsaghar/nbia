-need to hear from Stuart's must-changes.
-need to hear back from the workspace on the suggested changes.

Janice's interpretation.

1. For data element not in DICOM header....
-those we really need to make sure we're in sync with the standard

2. DICOM informational only...
-not in the model
-caBIG would have priority in the syntax

vs.

Brian's interpretation "HOWEVER, terms can be used, and even definitions/header info form DICOM, IF THEY are unambiguous"
-Regardless if it's a element in the DICOM header.
-What is the criteria for an unambiguous data element or attribute?  (Dianne's question)
-Ability to hold DICOM as an alternate definition will be there.

What will be the Review Team's must-changes
-Some class name changes?
-Are the underlying concepts changes?

Effort Required
0. Model in EA. 
1. Some Property name changes.
2. Minimal class name and attribute name changes
3. SIW mappings will change. (Making sure sure concepts map to everything)
4. Dianne mentioned we will have to retire concepts not being used.
