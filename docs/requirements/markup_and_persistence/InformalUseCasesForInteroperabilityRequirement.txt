Informal list of the use case scenarios discussed for the import/export of DICOM part 10 files, in regards to the interoperability requirement in the Cedara SOW. 

Scenario 1:
1.	User loads a given series with previously done markup into I-Response using the NCIA interface.
2.	XML markup is transferred from the NCIA, where it has been persisted, to I-Response
3.	I-Response displays the markup in the UI.
4.	User then exports the markup to a local DICOM part 10 file, through the use of a UI control in I-Response, for import into I-SoftView.

Scenario 2:
1.	User loads a given series with no markup into I-Response using the NCIA interface.
2.	User performs and completes markup using I-Response.
3.	User then exports the markup to a local DICOM part 10 file, through the use of a UI control in I-Response, for import into I-SoftView.

Scenario 3:
1.	User loads a given series with no markup into I-Response using the NCIA interface.
2.	User imports a DICOM part 10 file that contains image markup, for that particular series, into I-Response using a UI import mechanism.
3.	I-Response translates the DICOM part 10 data into markup capable of being displayed in the series.
4.	I-Response then displays the markup.
5.	User reviews the markup, possibly making changes, then saves the markup in the I-Response client.
6.	I-Response stores all the markup as XML and sends the data to the NCIA for persistence.

Scenario 4:
1.	User loads a given series with no markup into I-Response using the NCIA interface.
2.	User imports a DICOM part 10 file that contains image markup, for that particular series, into I-Response using a UI import mechanism.
3.	I-Response translates the DICOM part 10 data into markup capable of being displayed in the series.
4.	I-Response then displays the markup.
5.	User reviews the markup, possibly making changes, then saves the markup in the I-Response client.
6.	User then exports the markup to a new DICOM part 10 file, through the use of a UI control in I-Response, for import into I-SoftView.

CEDARA RESPONSE:
Not implementing DICOM part 10 functionality.   Requirement was eliminated on April 11th.
