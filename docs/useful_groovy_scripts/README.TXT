These groovy scripts do a variety of things related to NBIA, DICOM and then just general stuff.

The cip folder is for scripts written specifically for CIP and may not be terribly useful outside that context or even going forward for them.

These scripts generally work, but you may have to tweak a few def's in order to use the script in a new context.

Typically, these scripts depend on third-parts jars like dcm4che or caGrid.  Typically just drop them into ~/.groovy/lib.
