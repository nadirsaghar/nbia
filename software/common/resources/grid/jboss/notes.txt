=JBOSS 4.0.4 Support for caGrid=

==Changes to Globus for JBOSS==
In order to deploy Globus to the Tomcat in JBOSS Globus WSRF-Core needs two specific modifications.
	1.  The AxisServlet needs to be able to support setting the root context based on the "webContext" 
	    variable set in the web.xml in the deployed wsrf.war/WEB-INF directory.  Code exists in globus CVS head.
	2.  The JNDIUtils needs to be modified to be able to suport adding the required context
	    to the existing JNDI that JBOSS starts up.  Code already exists in globus CVS head.
	   

These required modifications all come in a modified and rebuilt wsrf-core.jar file which will be 
placed into {jboss_globus_location}/lib post deploying globus into JBOSS.

 %> cd CAGRID_LOCATION/antfiles/jboss
 %> ant -f jboss.xml deployJBOSS -Djboss.dir="<path to your jboss deployment>"

==Post Deployment Edits to Tomcat==
Follow these directions for modifying the Tomcat installation for Tomcat 5.5:

* The tomcat ''server.xml'' file is located in ''{JBOSS_HOME}server/default/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar''
* [http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/common/javawscore/admin-index.html#javawscore-admin-tomcat-deploying]

* Make sure to shut off the 8080 connector by commenting that section out.
