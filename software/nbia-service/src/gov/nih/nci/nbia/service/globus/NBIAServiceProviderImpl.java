 * This class implements each method in the portType of the service.  Each method call represented
 * in the port type will be then mapped into the unwrapped implementation which the user provides
 * in the NBIAServiceImpl class.  This class handles the boxing and unboxing of each method call
 * so that it can be correctly mapped in the unboxed interface that the developer has designed and 
 * has implemented.  Authorization callbacks are automatically made for each method based
 * on each methods authorization requirements.
