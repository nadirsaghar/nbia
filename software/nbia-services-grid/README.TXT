The classes in this project are necessary for a client to invoke the
grid service, specifically the analytical methods of the grid service
that are used for "remote search".  DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ELSE IN HERE!!!

The jar generated by this project can and will be distributed to external
parties, so don't put any incidental V@$%^@#$%@ in here.
